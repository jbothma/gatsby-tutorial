  \ of Certain Rural Areas Act (1998), which provides for the transfer of certain\
  \ land to municipalities and certain other legal entities, as well as for the removal\

  \ for the division of the country into regions; and for the preparation of national\
  \ development plans, regional development plans, regional structure plans and urban\
  \ structure plans.\r\n* The Deeds Registries Act (1997), which provides for the\
  \ administration of the land registration system and the registration of land rights.\r\
  \n* The Land Survey Act (1997), which provides for the regulation of the survey\
  \ of land in South Africa.\r\n* The Sectional Titles Act (1986), which provides\
  \ for the division of buildings into sections and common property; the acquisition\
  \ of separate ownership in sections coupled with joint ownership in common property;\
  \ the control of certain incidents attached to separate ownership in sections, and\
  \ joint ownership in common property; the transfer of ownership of sections, and\
  \ the registration of sectional mortgage bonds and real rights in sections; the\
  \ conferring and registration of rights in and the disposal of common property;\
  \ the establishment of bodies corporate to control common property and for that\
  \ purpose to apply rules; and the establishment of a sectional titles regulation\
  \ board.\r\n* The Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (2013), which provides\
  \ for national land use\r\nmanagement and spatial planning systems; the development\
  \ of government facilities such as hospitals, clinics and schools; and rural development\
