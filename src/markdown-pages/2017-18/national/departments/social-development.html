intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Ensure protection against vulnerability by creating an\
  \ enabling environment\nfor the provision of a comprehensive, integrated and sustainable\
  \ social\ndevelopment service._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Social Development\
  \ is not established in terms of a single\nact. Several pieces of legislation determine\
  \ its mandate, including the Social\nAssistance Act (2004), which provides a legislative\
  \ framework for providing\nsocial assistance. The act sets out the different types\
  \ of grants payable, as\nwell as their qualifying criteria. It also makes provision\
  \ for the\nestablishment of the inspectorate for social assistance. Other pieces\
  \ of\nlegislation further define the department\u2019s mandate:\n\n  * The Non-Profit\
  \ Organisations Act (1997) establishes an administrative and regulatory framework\
  \ within which non-profit organisations can conduct their affairs, and provides\
  \ for their registration by the department. \n\n  * The Older Persons Act (2006)\
  \ establishes a framework for empowering and protecting older persons, and promoting\
  \ and maintaining their status, rights, wellbeing, safety and security. It provides\
  \ for older persons to enjoy good quality services while staying with their families\
  \ in their communities for as long as possible. It also makes provision for older\
  \ persons to live in residential care facilities. \n\n  * The Children\u2019s Act\
  \ (2005) sets out principles relating to the care and protection of children, and\
  \ defines parental responsibilities and rights. It deals with early childhood development\
  \ (ECD), drop-in centres and early intervention, children in alternative care such\
  \ as foster care, child and youth care centres and the adoption of children. The\
  \ national ECD policy aims to define the provision of equitable ECD services in\
  \ South Africa. \n\n  * The Prevention of and Treatment for Substance Abuse Act\
  \ (2008) regulates substance abuse services and facilities. \n\n  * The 1998 White\
  \ Paper on Population Policy for South Africa is aimed at promoting the sustainable\
  \ development of all South Africans by integrating population issues with development\
  \ planning in all spheres of government and all sectors of society.\n\n  * The national\
  \ disability rights policy deepens the mainstreaming trajectory for realising the\
  \ rights of persons with disabilities. The policy does this through the development\
  \ of targeted interventions that apply the principles of universal design, and guide\
  \ the review of existing and development of new sectoral legislation and policies,\
  \ programmes, budgets and reporting systems to bring these in line with constitutional\
  \ and international treaty obligations. \n\n  * The 1997 White Paper for Social\
  \ Welfare sets out the principles, guidelines, policies and programmes for developmental\
  \ social welfare in South Africa. It provides the foundation for social welfare\
  \ in the post-1994 era.\n\n"
