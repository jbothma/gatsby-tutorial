intro: "## Mandate\n\nSection 10 (1) of the Constitution provides that: \u201CThe\
  \ legislative authority of a province is vested in its provincial legislature. \
  \ Section 114(1) and (2) of the Constitution provide further for the powers of a\
  \ Provincial Legislature to include; (a) the consideration, passing, amendment or\
  \ rejection of bills; (b) to initiate or prepare legislation, except money bills;\
  \ (c) to ensure that all provincial executive organs of state in the province are\
  \ accountable to it and (d) to maintain oversight of the exercise of provincial\
  \ executive authority in the province, including the implementation of legislation\
  \ and any provincial organ of state.\nIn addition to its constitutional mandate\
  \ and obligations, the general and specific powers of the Legislature are set out\
  \ in Rules 127 to 130 of the Standing Rules and Orders.\nThe Legislature has developed\
  \ a range of policies pertaining to elected representatives, political parties,\
  \ staff and various institutional practices in order to guide and regulate the daily\
  \ implementation of services and projects.  In respect of such policies, the review\
  \ highlighted the need to ensure that existing shortcomings and weaknesses are identified\
  \ and that key legislation and good governance principles, are incorporated into\
  \ the existing policy framework. \nThe provincial strategic outcomes developed by\
  \ the Executive are the key points of departure that define the priorities for the\
  \ province.  Within this framework, the Legislature has to engage with and identify\
  \ whether there are any gaps or whether enabling policy is required to support the\
  \ achievement of provincial goals. The Legislature, also has to prioritise how it\
  \ will meaningfully perform oversight to ensure delivery against the stated strategies.\
  \  \n\n## Vision\n\nThe vision of the Free State Legislature is in line with its\
  \ mandate as derived from the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act\
  \ 108 of 1996). The vision encapsulates the core principles of the Legislature as\
  \ follows; \u201CAn Activist Legislature that Champions Democracy\u201D.\n\n## Mission\n\
  \nTo promote good governance and a culture of human rights through oversight, law-making\
  \ and public participation. \n\n"
