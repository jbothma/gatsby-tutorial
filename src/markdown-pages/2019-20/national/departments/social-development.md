  \ enabling environment for the provision of a comprehensive, integrated and sustainable\
  \ social development service. \n\n## Vote mandate\n\nThe Department of Social Development\

  \ its mandate, many of which are under review. This includes the Social Assistance\
  \ Act (2004), which provides a legislative framework for providing social assistance.\
  \ The act sets out the different types of grants payable, as well as their qualifying\
  \ criteria. It also makes provision for the establishment of the inspectorate for\
  \ social assistance. Other pieces of legislation further define the department\u2019\
  s mandate:\n\u2022 the Non-Profit Organisations Act (1997) establishes an administrative\
  \ and regulatory framework within which non-profit organisations can conduct their\
  \ affairs, and provides for their registration by the department\n\u2022 the Older\
  \ Persons Act (2006) establishes a framework for empowering and protecting older\
  \ persons, and promoting and maintaining their status, rights, wellbeing, safety\
  \ and security. It provides for older persons to enjoy good quality services while\
  \ staying with their families in their communities for as long as possible. It also\
  \ makes provision for older persons to live in residential care facilities \n\u2022\
  \ the Children\u2019s Act (2005) sets out principles relating to the care and protection\
  \ of children, and defines parental responsibilities and rights. It deals with early\
  \ childhood development (ECD), drop-in centres and early intervention, children\
  \ in alternative care such as foster care, child and youth care centres, and the\
  \ adoption of children\n\u2022 the Prevention of and Treatment for Substance Abuse\
  \ Act (2008) regulates substance abuse services and facilities\n\u2022 the 1998\
  \ White Paper on Population Policy for South Africa is aimed at promoting the sustainable\
  \ development of all South Africans by integrating population issues with development\
  \ planning in all spheres of government and all sectors of society\n\u2022 the 2015\
  \ White Paper on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities focuses on putting in place\
  \ measures that will reduce the exclusion and inequality experienced by persons\
  \ with disabilities. This includes contributing towards fighting poverty among persons\
  \ with disabilities and their families, and providing policy guidelines on building\
  \ capacity in the public sector to deliver equitable and accessible services\n\u2022\
  \ the 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare sets out the principles, guidelines, policies\
  \ and programmes for developmental social welfare in South Africa. It provides the\
  \ foundation for social welfare in the post-1994 era\n\u2022 the Social Service\
  \ Professions Act (1978) provides for the regulation of social service professionals\
  \ \n\u2022 the Victim Empowerment Support Services Bill is aimed at regulating victim\
  \ support services and empowering victims. \n"
